	Purpose:Chapter 13 Exercise

	modify3.html asks the user to submit their hours worked and pay rate.
	modify3.php uses functions from the inc-wage-functions.php file to
	calculate the wage and bonus. The program also calls a function
	named getOvertimeHours() in order to display the number of overtime
	hours worked. However this function does not exist!

	Modify inc-wage-functions.php by adding this function. The function
	should be designed to receive the hours worked and return the
	number of overtime hours. If the hours worked is 40 or less,
	the function should return 0, otherwise the function should return
	the the result of subtracting 40 from the hours worked.
